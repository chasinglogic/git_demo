# Git Demo

This is a small script that is to be used for the demo portion of my
[I don't Git it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zC8fprEw_M) talk I
have scripted it out so that the demo is consistent and well documented.

You can run the demo yourself by simply running `./git_demo.sh` it
will step you through a typical git workflow. It's useful as a
reference but of course it's meant to be talked over so I'm not sure
how useful it will be to someone not familiar with git.
